## Assignment 1: DDL Processing for Parallel DBMS

This first assignment guides you through the implementation of the DDL processing component of a parallel SQL processing system. The parallel SQL processing system consists of a cluster of DBMS instances running on different machines (possibly virtual machines). DDLs submitted to the system will need to be translated into corresponding DDLs for each individual DBMS instance in the cluster and executed there. In addition a catalog database stores metadata about what data is stored for each table on each DBMS instance in the cluster.

For more detail, please see the [assignment 1 page](https://lipyeow.github.io/ics421s18/morea/pardb/experience-hw1.html).
